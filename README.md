# Car-Features-on-Price-and-Profitability

**Project Description**
The car industry has been changing a lot in the past few decades. People now care more about making cars that use less fuel, are good for the environment, and have new technologies. Many car companies are competing, and what people want in a car is also changing.

Recently, more people are interested in electric and hybrid cars, and some are looking into other fuels like hydrogen and natural gas. But regular cars that use gasoline are still very popular, and there are different kinds of gasoline too.

As a Data Analyst, the client wants to know how a car company can decide on the best price and features for a car to make the most money while giving people what they want.

To solve this problem, we can look at the data about a car's features, what category it falls into, and how much it costs. By using fancy data analysis techniques, like looking at the relationship between features, market category, and pricing, we can figure out what features and categories people like the most and what makes the most money for the company. This can help the company decide on prices and what features to focus on when making new cars. Overall, this can make the company more competitive and make more money in the long run.
